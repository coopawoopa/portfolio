Continents are then split into local areas, each with its own local and global index. Routing links these local areas, with some randomness deciding if paths are created between areas on the same continent. Connections are made by finding adjacent areas, figuring out paths through walls or barriers with adjacency rules, and generating pathways or mazes to link them. The script includes helper functions to clean and merge grids, spot walls, and pick entrance points, adding a bit of randomness when deciding between maze or path generation for the connections.',

Propagation uses a queue to spread the constraints from the collapsed cell to its neighbours. The neighbours are updated based on the overlap rules, which define valid tiles in adjacent positions. If the neighbour<q>s possible tiles change, the neighbour is added to the queue, and the process continues until all constraints are updated. This ensures consistency across the entire grid.',

When the map size exceeds a 20x20 grid, multiple isolated regions often form, which can prevent proper gameplayâ€”such as when the player and enemy spawn on different islands with no path between them. The solution was to implement a method to identify and remove all but the largest island. The "CheckForDisconnectedRegionsAndConnect" method was initially designed to connect separate islands, but it was later simplified to just identify islands and remove the smaller ones, leaving only the largest connected region. The "IsNotInvalidTile" method ensures that empty tiles (" ") are ignored when identifying islands, preventing them from being treated as separate regions.',
